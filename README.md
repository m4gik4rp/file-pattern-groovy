# File Pattern Groovy
üí° Completed with a duration of **2 hours and 10 minutes** 

üí° Used **'Trunk-based development'** 

üí° Final answer is **FilePattern.groovy**. 

## Description

Hey there! I created two versions of File Pattern Groovy: one for interactive use, called **FilePattern.groovy**, and another for command-line operation, named **CLFilePattern.groovy**. The interactive mode was my **official attempt**, but I realized I missed out on using command line arguments, so I crafted the command-line mode to address that.

Since I'm relatively new to Groovy, I sought guidance from ChatGPT for examples and syntax help. It's been a learning process, and I hope these two versions serve you well!
